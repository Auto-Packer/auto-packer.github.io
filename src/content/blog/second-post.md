In this guide, we walk through the end-to-end process of packaging a complex installer for deployment with Microsoft Intune. We'll take a standard `.exe` installer, wrap it using the PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit, convert it to the `.intunewin` format, and deploy it with precise detection methods.

Key steps covered in the video:
- **Wrapping with PSADT:** Creating a robust and user-friendly installation experience.
- **The `Install-Application.ps1` script:** Customizing the installation and uninstallation commands.
- **Using the `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`:** Compressing the package for upload.
- **Creating the App in Intune:** Defining the install commands, detection rules, and user assignments.

This process ensures your Intune deployments are as reliable and professional as your SCCM packages.
